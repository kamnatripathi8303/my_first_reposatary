# 🧠 Sales Prediction using Python

This project uses **Machine Learning (Linear Regression)** to predict product sales based on advertising spending on TV, Radio, and Newspaper.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains advertising costs and sales numbers.  
Columns:  
- TV  
- Radio  
- Newspaper  
- Sales  

## ⚙️ Tools Used
